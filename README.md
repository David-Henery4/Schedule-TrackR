# Schedule TrackR

Schedule TrackR is a web app that helps users to keep track of their overall and day to day schedule, in order to help boost productivity and improve their time management.

## How to use

Schedule TrackR can be found at [schedule tracker](#"ScheduleTrackR").

When you first open schedule trackR you will start on the months page. From here you can choose what one of three main features you would like to use.
Creating a schedule, creating goals or creating a todo list.

The "current week", "month", "weeks" and "day" all interact or display the schedule data.

The "To do's" page only handles the todos data, while the "Goals" only handles the goals data.

## Creating and handling a schedule

In order to start creating a schedule, the user has to first choose when they want to create a schedule. When they know a date, they can find the date by choosing the month on the "month" page, then they will be taken to the "weeks" page for them select a specific date in that month. Once they have selected the date, the "day" page will then display that date and the user can add activities to their schedule for that date.

From then on, all schedule data created for this date will always be visiable on the "day" page on that current date.
The user can use this to create and view their schedule for any date they want.

In the "current week" page the users schedule for that current week will be displayed and split up into the different days of the week, while also remaining in time order.

There is a option for the user to edit or delete individual activities from their schedule in ether the "day" page or the "current week" page by clicking the icon in the top right of the activity tab.
